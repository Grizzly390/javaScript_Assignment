Q. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to control the flow of the program based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are the if, else if, and else statements. 

1. If Statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
    
    syntax:
    if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
    }

    Example:
    let x = 10;
    if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
    }

2. If-Else Statement:
The if-else statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

    syntax:
    if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
    } else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
    }

    Example:
    let y = 3;
    if (y % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("y is even");
    } else {
    console.log("y is odd");
    }

3. If-Else If-Else Statement:
The if-else if-else statement is used when there are multiple conditions to be checked.

    syntax:
    if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
    } else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
    }

    if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
    } else {
    // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
    }
