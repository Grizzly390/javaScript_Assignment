Q- What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They allow us to store values and manipulate them throughout the course of our program. Declaring variables is a fundamental aspect of programming, as it enables us to work with data in a dynamic and flexible manner.

The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript. Here's how we use it:
    let variableName;
        This statement declares a variable named variableName using the let keyword. However, at this point, the variable is declared but not initialized, meaning it does not yet hold a specific value.

    We can later assign a value to the variable:
    let variableName;
    variableName = 42;

    Alternatively, we can combine declaration and assignment in a single line:
    let variableName = 42;

It's worth noting that the let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and is the preferred way to declare variables in modern JavaScript. Prior to ES6, var was commonly used, but let has some advantages, including block-scoping behavior, which can help prevent certain types of bugs.
