Q- List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

JavaScript has several primitive data types that are the basic building blocks for representing and manipulating data.

1. Number:
    Represents numeric values.
    
    Can be integers or floating-point numbers.
    
    Examples: 1, 3.14, -7.

2. String:
    Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backtick ( ) quotes.
    
    Examples: 'hello', "world", `backtick`.

3. Boolean:
    Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
    
    Used for decision-making and conditional expressions.
    
    Examples: true, false.

4. Null:
    Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    
    It's a special value assigned to a variable to indicate the absence of a meaningful value.
    
    Example: let myVar = null;

5. Undefined:
    Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
    
    It's the default value of variables that are declared but not initialized.
    
    Example: let x; // x is undefined until a value is assigned.

These primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created.
