Q-Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.

JavaScript and HTML are both essential technologies for web development, but they serve different purposes and are used in different ways.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

    Purpose:
    HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web.

    It defines the structure and layout of a web page using elements and tags.

    Example:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Title of my Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

    Usage:
    HTML is used to create the basic structure of a web page.

    It defines headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and other elements.

    Responsibility:
    HTML is responsible for the static, structural content of a web page.


JavaScript:

    Purpose:
    JavaScript is a scripting language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
    
    It enables manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and handles events.

    Example:
    JavaScript code to change the content of an HTML element:
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, JavaScript!";

    Usage:
    JavaScript is used for client-side scripting to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
    
    It can be used for form validation, DOM manipulation, handling events, and making asynchronous requests (AJAX).

    Responsibility:
    JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity, handling user input, and dynamically updating the content of a web page.

Situations Where HTML is Used:
    Defining the structure and layout of a web page.
    
    Creating headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other elements.
    
    Embedding images, videos, and other media.
    
    Establishing links to navigate between pages.
    
    Providing metadata through elements like <head> for SEO and other purposes.

Situations Where JavaScript is Used:
    Validating user input in forms.
    
    Creating interactive elements like sliders, carousels, and accordions.

    Handling events such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.

    Making asynchronous requests to fetch data from a server without reloading the entire page.
    
    Modifying the DOM dynamically to update content without requiring a page refresh.
