Q-Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

1. Unary Operators:
    Unary operators act on a single operand.
    
    Example:
    var x = 5;
    var y = -x;  // Unary minus operator

    Common unary operators include:

    + (Unary plus): Converts an operand to a number.
    - (Unary minus): Negates its operand.
    ++ (Increment): Increases the numeric value of its operand by 1.
    -- (Decrement): Decreases the numeric value of its operand by 1.
    ! (Logical NOT): Inverts the boolean value of its operand.

2. Binary Operators:
    Binary operators require two operands.
    
    Example:
    var a = 5;
    var b = 3;
    var sum = a + b;  // Addition operator

    Common binary operators include:

    + (Addition)
    - (Subtraction)
    * (Multiplication)
    / (Division)
    % (Modulus)
    === (Strict equality)
    !== (Strict inequality)
    && (Logical AND)
    || (Logical OR)

3. Ternary Operator:
    The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is the only ternary operator in JavaScript.
    
    It takes three operands and is often used as a shortcut for an if-else statement.
    
    Syntax:
    var result = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

    Example:

    var age = 20;
    var status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';

    In this example, if the condition (age >= 18) is true, the status variable will be assigned the value 'Adult', otherwise, it will be assigned the value 'Minor'.
