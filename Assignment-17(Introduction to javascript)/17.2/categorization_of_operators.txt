Q- Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.

Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality into several groups. 

1. Arithmetic Operators:
    Perform arithmetic operations on numeric values.
    Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo)
    
    let a = 10;
    let b = 3;

    console.log(a + b); // 13
    console.log(a - b); // 7
    console.log(a * b); // 30
    console.log(a / b); // 3.333...
    console.log(a % b); // 1

2. Assignment Operators:
    Assign values to variables.
    Examples: = (assignment), += (addition assignment), -=, *=, /=, %=.

    let x = 5;
    x += 3; // equivalent to x = x + 3; // x is now 8

3. Comparison Operators:
    Compare values and return Boolean results.
    Examples: == (equal), === (strict equal), != (not equal), !== (strict not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), >= (greater than or equal).

    let num1 = 10;
    let num2 = 5;

    console.log(num1 > num2); // true
    console.log(num1 === num2); // false

4. Logical Operators:

    Perform logical operations on Boolean values.
    Examples: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).

    let isSunny = true;
    let isWarm = true;

    if (isSunny && isWarm) {
    console.log("It's a sunny and warm day!");
    }

5. Unary Operators:

    Act on a single operand.
    Examples: - (negation), + (unary plus), ++ (increment), -- (decrement).

    let number = 5;
    console.log(-number); // -5

6. String Operators:

    Concatenate strings.
    Example: + (string concatenation).

    let firstName = "Himanshu";
    let lastName = "Kumar";

    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Himanshu Kumar"
